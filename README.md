# Data Structure and Algorithm

- Stack
    Stack have 2 operations, the push and pop. Push is the operation we use for adding while pop is the operation we use for deleting. In Stack we always add and delete at head. It follows the concept of LIFO (Last In First Out)
- Queues
    Queues have 2 operations, the queue and dequeue. Queues is very similar to Stack but it follows the principle of FIFO (First In First Out)
- BST
    It is composed of nodes connected to each other. Each node has a maximum children of 2. BST have a time complexity of O(n). The node from the left is always less than to its parent while the node from the right is always greater than to its parent. It has many operation including insertion, searching and deletion.
